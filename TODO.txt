-Build an item-item collaborative engine (e.g. takes 1 movie as input and returns k-neighbours similar movies)
-Build a user-item collaborative engine (e.g. based on all your ratings, return k-neighbours based on similar user's tastes)

-Find some "golden list" to compare my results to. e.g. based on a metric like rmse or WARP, OR comparing them to existing models in spotlight, lightfm and surprise
-All algorithms need to output the same format e.g. a list of recommendations
X-Make the lightfm alg also output a score per recommendation
-Update lightfm algs (and future algs) to work with my input datasets
