X-Build an item-item collaborative engine (e.g. takes 1 movie as input and returns k-neighbours similar movies)
X-Build a user-item collaborative engine (e.g. based on all your ratings, return k-neighbours based on similar user's tastes)

X-Find some "golden list" to compare my results to. e.g. based on a metric like rmse or WARP, OR comparing them to existing models in spotlight, lightfm and surprise
X-All algorithms need to output the same format e.g. a list of recommendations
X-Make the lightfm alg also output a score per recommendation
X-Update lightfm algs (and future algs) to work with my input datasets

X-Create new splitting formula that allows some movies to be shared between splits (emulates real life) (This might already be done in intermittent split)
-Create graph of federated results
-Update ndcg score to use the one from scikitlearn
-Experiment with different relevance values for ndcg
-Add other metrics as well as ndcg, for reporting purposes
-Potentially use h20.ai to find better mapping models
-Potentially include tags/genres/implicit data in the mapper to improve it
-normalise user ratings (so users who always rate positively are penalised, e.g. take averages) (then we'll have negative ratings)
-Save svd to file to reduce runtime
