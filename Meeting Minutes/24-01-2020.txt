first try a linear normalisation (find the scaling factor for each)
use a learning function to normalise/create a mapping between algs
running on one split, the model should be generalisable to any other splits
may need to change the splitting method: 
Have a holdout split to test the normaliser
report both golden lists (if there are 2 algs) against the fedarated lists
golden list should be one alg on 1 split (representing a provider eg netflix or disney) and federated runs on several split
ndcg@k number (usually 5 or 10) can try 100 (aka larger k) (use both shallow and deep) (but primarily use shallow k)
precision recall and map are other possible metrics
For normaliser first try: simply try to map score one to score two, and more complicated can include one hot encoding for tags, genres etc.
First generate golden list from both algs on the whole dataset (so there are 2 golden lists) then run the algs on individual splits (to generate 2 more lists) and finally a federated list. Then compare all 3 with the golden lists
