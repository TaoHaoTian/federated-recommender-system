discussed spotlight not working on python 3.7, nikos sent me an email with a fix for that
Install Cuda, works even without nvidia, needed for pytorch and hence spotlight
BPR is possibly better, but WARP usually wins, so may as well report both for more results
In the background section have a paragraph for BPR and WARP, and then don't discuss it again until the performance review
Look at MRR mean recipricol rank, common
Use the existing metrics, don't need to implement them yourself
Offline vs online evaluation, offline easiest and cheapest
Online would involve ethics
A/B testing: but create a list of recs where items from system A and B are weaved intermittedely, and the order of whether A or B is first in the list is randomly mixed.
Can post it online, and then we don't ethics approval
e.g. reddit, but need a disclaimer that user accepts ie gdpr
Start looking at ethics approval, and figure out what kind of questions will be asked
Dont use every algorithm
Use the best algorithm for each 'slice' of the dataset
write a script that tries many different algorithms and tweaks parameters to find the best alg for each slice
specify set of hyper parameters, then exhaustively tweak each one one at a time
grid search cross validation
some metrics might not work for some algs, but all need to be the same in the end
Explain why i picked each algorithm
One engine per data slice
See if it's possible to integrate many different movie databases together
