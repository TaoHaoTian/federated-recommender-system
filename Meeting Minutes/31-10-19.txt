Can train on both slices or everything
Start with simply matching movie ids, assume they are the same
then we can create embeddings (vectors) for each movie if we have time
can do the split method I mentioned, or split movies into groups, try both
Split whole dataset into a test and training set thats used FOR THE FEDERATOR, as well as n number of datasets for each algorithm to use. The algorithm then splits their respective datasets into a training and test set for them to train with.
For the federator, extract entire users from dataset first to have whole user profiles, then split dataset afterwards however we want
Golden lists
Next meeting, discuss design of federator

TODO: 
- before splitting into the datasets for the federator, remove some movies entirely to populate federator test and training sets with complete movies
- split movielens dataset with my method
- research about golden lists
