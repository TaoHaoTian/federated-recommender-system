use precison/recall/accuracy for checking rankings (e.g. how many items exist in the predicted arr that also exist in the golden list)
for ndcg use the scores predicted by the algs, and use raw svd with mapped lfm to svd scores with the golden svd and vice versa for lfm
(for ndcg) map the top k items in the predicted arr to their scores in the golden list
Or generate the entire scored list in order of movie and and input both in with a set k

Intro just sets the scene, provide motivations
Mention that the program can work with other datasets/parameters with not much change, its not a bespoke solultion
In related work: explain how those works are not good enough and how mine differs (e.g. Richard's applies to search engines whereas ours applies to recs)
And this is probably the first work to do this (check online if true)
Look back at the papers nikos sent me in summer and include those related work
instead of inputting just the score, also include the one hot encoding of genres for eg
