could move surprise's specific implementation and background be more general (just svd, not surprises specific implementation)
write a bit more for sgd
can include the fact that the solution is not bespoke in contributions.
contributions - both federators, for each one of these, include sub-contributions. Include how each of them perform.
be more specific with dataset handling methods (ie they create synthetic datasets for surprise and lfm)
contributions: open source project that can be used with future algs

can compute raw lfm against svd golden list and vice versa for a baseline
get precision and recall for ndcg methods
vary values of ndcg@k to see how scores change, graph it by removing total bar and showing different k values next to each other

have a graph mapping the reverse as well to see how ndcg is affected

use rmse to calculate the results of the map on the original algs true scores

roleplay as an extreme user to give qualititive feedback on recommenders e.g. i would watch these movies that have been recommended

make graphs shorter but keep width

future work: use genre in mapper, other regression methods

its ok to be a bit informal

extract sgd to work with both lfm and svd
