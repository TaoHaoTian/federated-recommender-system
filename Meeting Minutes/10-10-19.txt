Use MAE and RMSE when you have pointwise loss functions (ie explicit feedback)
but implicit neither are useful
Other metrics: R2, Area under ROC
Use whichever metric looks better, but still report all metrics
Choose if we want to use implicit feedback too, seems like a good idea
Ranking recommender algs
Pointwise loss: like RMSE and MAE  
Pairwise loss: check the order is right for two items for example, so it gives a relative ordering of which items rank best
Pairwise loss functions: WARP, BPR
Pairwise for implicit data as rankings are more meaningful than 0.05% probability for example
Pairwise ranking metrics: MRR (Mean Recipricol Ranking)
Metadata (e.g. user profile) not implicit or explicit data in the sense of RS, but instead can give genres weightings and hence recommend them more
Embedding: numerical representation of something that's not numerical
Can use this to compare user profiles
Can also use embeddings for item profiles, to compare similar items
Word2Vec: embeddings of all english words to vectors
Item2Vec: Looks at col or row and squashes it into an embedding
have to convert implicit/explicit to the opposite if 
Decide if implicit or explicit is better, experiment with both
Nikos will send me another email with reading about how to map different algorithms together so a federator can compare them and decide which is better
