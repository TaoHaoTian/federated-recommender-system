Questions:

-Is it ok to have assumption sections for each design point as bullet points? or convert to prose
-global design, sadd design and dasd design in 3 chapters, is this ok?
-default citation format is fine? and other defaults?
-In design section, how specific do i need to be about implementation? right now im explaining the maths/equations behind my methods but not specific implementations
-can I cite a web article? It claims theres a study but no link to it. For the sake of determining dataset sizes
-implemented gbm, it performed better than linear regression, should compare these results or just show gbr?
