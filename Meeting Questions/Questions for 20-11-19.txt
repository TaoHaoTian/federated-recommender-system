- Implemented k nearest neighbours algorithm
- Added fuzzymatching
- Added more functionality to data slicing

- Collaborative or content based filtering? I think we should focus on collaborative
- What's the difference between content-based filtering and item-based collaborative filtering?
- ValueError: Unstacked DataFrame is too big, causing int32 overflow pandas >0.21, doesnt work with ml-20m
- hence thinking of using pure np and not pandas

Next steps:
- Implement Alternating Least Square (ALS) Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering
- Merge the results of those into one combined list
- Convert existing code from pandas to np
