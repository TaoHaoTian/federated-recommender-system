I want to implement some other basic hybrid rec systems, like weighted and combsum

LFM NDCG@20 Score: 0.97302
SVD NDCG@20 Score: 0.93964
are these too high? they map directly to the normalised golden list score. If more lfm items appear in the higher rankings it makes sense that it has a higher score.
I think these results arent too meaningful, how to make them more meaningful? since we're essentially comparing the federated list with both golden lists.
Should these scores be as similar as possible?
