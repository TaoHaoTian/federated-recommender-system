After experimenting with surprises SVD alg, I think there will always be a big difference between matrix factorisation algs and knn algs. 
Since I think these will always give largely different results, is it worth experimenting to see if I can federate these? If so, how?
Surprise's SVD alg is returning perfect scores for some items. Should i try to change this behaviour?
