What I've Done:
-Created git repo with kanban board, issues and template files
-Collated a list of useful datasets
-Set up latex to build locally
-Tried a few Python recommender algorithms

Questions:
-Is this considered a Research-style project or a Software-Engineering-style project
-When would the dissertation need to be ready by to be available for publication consideration
-I've looked at a few existing Python libraries with various recommender algorithms. Question which algorithms make the most sense to use.
-The springer reading you sent me seems to no longer be accessible
-Since I couldn't read about those, how would I go about federating recommender algorithms?
-Ask about the queries part of the example system architecture on the slides
-Clarify the meaning of the stages in the rough time schedule on the slides
X-Github repo is private, shall I add you to it?

What to do next:
-Start trying the Python recommender algs with the datasets found
-Think about a way to federate these algs
