-discussing that this is not a bespoke solution, put this in problem formulation or design?
-Contributions - how should I phrase them? broad e.g. made the federator and how it federates?
-Weaving gives the best ndcg score (makes sense considering how ndcg works), how do we go about showing other methods might be effective too? Should weaving give the best result in theory?
-placement of figures, do they matter? where should I put them in the latex text?
-section titles should be very factual? or more playful
-my background sections are quite explanatory, like im explaining something. Should this be saved for the design/implementation section, and instead should I use a more passive, factual tone? Do we need graphs/figures in background to explain the ideas?
-should the background section discuss any specifics to my project?
-Can you check my diss to see if the language is suitable and if I've gone into too little/too much detail at certain parts?
-LFM is also a matrix factorisation method (like SVD), do I need to explicitly describe its algorithm or be more broad? I've already explained SVD's specifics (and should the specifics for svd be discussed?)
