What I've Done:
- set up testing and logging environments
- created methods to split the dataset, including ratio splitting of any size
- created sorting methods, including intermittent and random
- couldn't find much info about golden lists

Questions:
- Is it possible to concatenate 2d arrays that have different row count? (but same col count)
