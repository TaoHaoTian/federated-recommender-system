Is what I have enough to write a diss on?
-Currently a crude mapper (will try to improve with h20.ai
-Individual splits mapper that mirrors reality
-ndcg results of both of these federators

I think I need more

Here's what I've done for the diss so far, could you check it for me?
-Abstract
-Background
-Related Works

Which section should my algorithm descriptions/choices/explanations be?
Perhaps check to see if scale (i.e. bigger movielens datsets) affects the federator?
